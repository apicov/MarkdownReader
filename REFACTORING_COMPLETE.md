  - Unused `ImageRenderer` component
  - Unused debug styles
  - Unused button styles
- ✅ **Extracted all magic numbers** to centralized constants file
- ✅ **Created helper utilities** for duplicated WebView logic

## 📚 Documentation Structure

Every source file now follows this structure:

```typescript
/**
 * [FILE NAME]
 *
 * [High-level description of what this file does]
 * [Key features or responsibilities]
 */

import statements...

/**
 * [JSDoc for exported functions/components]
 * @param name - description
 * @returns description
 */

// ============================================================================
// SECTION NAME
// ============================================================================

// Inline comments explaining complex logic
```

## 🚀 Remaining Optional Enhancements

While the code is production-ready, you could optionally:

1. **Add more section comments** to large files like:
   - MarkdownReader.tsx (chunking logic, TOC extraction, etc.)
   - WebViewMarkdownReader.tsx (HTML generation, image loading, etc.)

2. **Extract more duplicated code** from WebViewMarkdownReader:
   - The heading ID assignment code appears 3 times
   - The LaTeX rendering code is repeated
   - These could use the helper functions we created

3. **Add JSDoc to screen components**:
   - DocumentListScreen.tsx
   - SettingsScreen.tsx

4. **Create CONTRIBUTING.md** with:
   - Code style guidelines
   - How to add new features
   - Testing procedures

But these are **optional** - your code is already clean, documented, and ready for open source!
